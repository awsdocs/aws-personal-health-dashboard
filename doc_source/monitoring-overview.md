# Logging and monitoring in AWS Health<a name="monitoring-overview"></a>

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of AWS Health and your other AWS solutions\. AWS provides the following monitoring tools to watch AWS Health, report when something is wrong, and take actions when appropriate:
+ *Amazon CloudWatch* monitors your AWS resources and the applications that you run on AWS in real time\. You can collect and track metrics, create customized dashboards, and set alarms that notify you or take actions when a specified metric reaches a threshold that you specify\. For example, you can have CloudWatch track CPU usage or other metrics of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances and automatically launch new instances when needed\. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)\.
+ *Amazon CloudWatch Events* delivers a near\-real\-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources\. CloudWatch Events enables automated event\-driven computing\. You can write rules that watch for certain events and trigger automated actions in other AWS services when these events happen\. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/)\.
+ *AWS CloudTrail* captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket that you specify\. You can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred\. For more information, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)\.
