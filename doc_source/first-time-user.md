AWS Health provides a console, called the AWS Personal Health Dashboard, to all customers\. You do not need to write code or perform any actions to set up the dashboard\. If you have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, you can access the information presented on the dashboard programmatically\. You can use the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) or write code to make requests, by using either the REST API directly or the AWS SDKs\.
