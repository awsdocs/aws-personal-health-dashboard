# Monitoring AWS Health Events with Amazon CloudWatch Events<a name="cloudwatch-events-health"></a>

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Events to detect and react to changes in the status of AWS Personal Health Dashboard \(AWS Health\) events\. Then, based on the rules that you create, CloudWatch Events invokes one or more target actions when an event matches the values that you specify in a rule\. Depending on the type of event, you can send notifications, capture event information, take corrective action, initiate events, or take other actions\. You can select the following types of targets when using CloudWatch Events as a part of your AWS Health workflow:
+ AWS Lambda functions
+  Kinesis streams
+ Amazon SQS queues
+ Built\-in targets \(CloudWatch alarm actions\)
+ Amazon SNS topics

The following are some use cases:
+ Use a Lambda function to pass a notification to a Slack channel when an event occurs\.
+ Send custom text or SMS notifications with Amazon SNS when an AWS Health event happens by using Lambda and CloudWatch Events\.

For samples of automation and customized alerts that you can create in response to AWS Health events, see the [AWS Health Tools](https://github.com/aws/aws-health-tools) in GitHub\.

**Note**  
Only those AWS Health events that are specific to your AWS account and resources are published to CloudWatch Events\. This includes events such as Amazon Elastic Block Store volume lost, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance store drive performance degraded, and all the scheduled change events\. In contrast, [Service Health Dashboard](https://status.aws.amazon.com) events provide information about the regional availability of a service and are not specific to AWS accounts, so they are not published to CloudWatch Events\. These event types have the word "operational" in the title in the Personal Health Dashboard; for example, "SWF operational issue"\.

The remainder of this topic describes the basic procedure for creating a CloudWatch Events rule for AWS Health\. Before you create event rules for AWS Health, however, you should do the following:
+ Familiarize yourself with events, rules, and targets in CloudWatch Events\. For more information, see [What Is Amazon CloudWatch Events?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html) and [New CloudWatch Events â€“ Track and Respond to Changes to Your AWS Resources](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cloudwatch-events-track-and-respond-to-changes-to-your-aws-resources/)\.
+ Create the target or targets to use in your event rules\.

**To create a CloudWatch Events rule for AWS Health:**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Events**\.

1. Choose **Create rule**, and then under **Event Source**, for **Service Name**, choose **Health**\.

1. Specify AWS services:
   + To make a rule that applies to all AWS services, for **Event Type**, choose **All Events**\. If you choose all events, you can't choose event type categories or event type codes\.
   + To make a rule that applies to events for one service only, choose **Specific Health events**, choose **Specific service\(s\)**, and then choose a service name from the list\. For example, **EC2**\. Note: you can't choose more than one service\.

1. Specify event type categories \(if you have selected a specific service\):
   + To make a rule that applies to all event type categories, choose **Any event type category**\.
   + To make a rule that applies to one event type category only, choose **Specific event type category\(s\)**, and then choose a value from the list\. For example, **scheduledChange**\. Note: you can't choose more than one category\.

1. Specify event type codes \(if you have selected a specific service and a specific event type category\):
   + To make a rule that applies to all event type codes, choose **Any event type code**\.
   + To make a rule that applies to one or more event type codes only, choose **Specific event type code\(s\)**, and then choose one or more values from the list\. For example, **AWS\_EC2\_PERSISTENT\_INSTANCE\_RETIREMENT\_SCHEDULED**\.

1. Specify affected resources:
   + To make a rule that applies to all resources, choose **Any resource**\.
   + To make a rule that applies to one or more resources only, choose **Specific resource\(s\)**, and then enter the IDs of one or more resources\. For example, **i\-a1b2c34f**\.

1. Review your rule setup to be sure it meets your event\-monitoring requirements\.

1. In the **Targets** area, choose **Add target\***\.

1. In the **Select target type** list, choose the type of target you prepared to use with this rule, and then configure any additional options required by that type\.

1. Choose **Configure details**\.

1. On the **Configure rule details** page, type a name and description for the rule, and then choose the **State** box to enable the rule as soon as it is created\.

1. If you're satisfied with the rule, choose **Create rule**\.

## Automating Actions for EC2 Instances<a name="automating-instance-actions"></a>

You can automate actions in response to new scheduled events for your EC2 instances\. For example, you can create CloudWatch Events rules for EC2 scheduled events generated by the AWS Health service\. These rules can then trigger targets, such as AWS Systems Manager Automation documents, to automate actions\. You can find more options at [Automating Amazon EC2 with CloudWatch Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/automating_with_cloudwatch_events.html)\.

 For example, when an Amazon EC2 instance retirement event is scheduled for an EBS\-backed EC2 instance, you can automate the stop and start of the instance so that you don't have to perform these actions manually\.

**Automate the stop and start of EBS\-backed EC2 instances that are scheduled for retirement**

1. Open the CloudWatch console to create a CloudWatch Events rule:
   + Go to the [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.
   + Under **Events**, choose **Rules**\.

1. Edit the Event Pattern Preview, and then insert the following inputs:  
**Example**  

   ```
   {
     "source": [
       "aws.health"
     ],
     "detail-type": [
       "AWS Health Event"
     ],
     "detail": {
       "service": [
         "EC2"
       ],
       "eventTypeCategory": [
         "scheduledChange"
       ],
       "eventTypeCode": [
         "AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

   You should see the following fields populate in the console:  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/images/automating-actions-1.jpg)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/)

1. Select **Save**\.

1. Add the Systems Manager Automation document target by selecting **Add target\***, and then selecting **SSM Automation**, as shown in this figure:  
**Example**    
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/images/automating-actions-2.jpg)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/)![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/)

1. Choose the **AWS\-RestartEC2Instance** Systems Manager document from the list\.

1. Configure the Input Transformer as shown here, with `{"Instances":"$.resources"}` as the InputPathsMap and `{"InstanceId": <Instances>}` as the **Input Template**\.

1. Choose an existing IAM role, and then create a new one with permissions to execute the SSM automation document\.

**If you don't have an existing IAM role with required EC2 and Systems Manager permissions, then create one**

1. Set up the required IAM permissions for CloudWatch Events to use by creating an IAM policy\. Then, associate it with an IAM role for CloudWatch\. For this example name the IAM role `AutomationCWRole`\. Here is an example of such an IAM policy:  
**Example**  

   ```
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "ec2:StartInstances",
           "ec2:StopInstances",
           "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "*"
         ]
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "ssm:*"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "*"
         ]
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "sns:Publish"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:sns:*:*:Automation*"
         ]
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "iam:PassRole"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::<AccountId>:role/AutomationCWRole"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

1. Be sure to update the role ARN with the account ID and role name\. Also, be sure that the role has **events\.amazonaws\.com** and **ssm\.amazonaws\.com** configured as a trusted entity for the IAM role as shown here:  
**Example**  

   ```
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "Service": [
             "ssm.amazonaws.com",
             "events.amazonaws.com"
           ]
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
